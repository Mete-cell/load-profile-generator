# load-profile-generator
The Python project generates BDEW standardized electrical load profiles for buildings, processing residential, commercial, agricultural and mixed-use properties with 15-minute intervals. It considers building type, floor area, day type and seasons, validates against BDEW standards, and exports results as CSV/JSON using parallel processing.
